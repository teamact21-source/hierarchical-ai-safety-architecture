  ## TL;DR
A safety architecture where a Primary AI operates under a strictly superior Supervisory AI (C+Δ),
aiming for structural safety via asymmetric control rather than guardrail enumeration.

## Why it matters
- Reduces reliance on brittle rule lists
- Provides a clear audit surface for humans
- Enables scalable oversight as capabilities grow

# Hierarchical AI Safety Architecture
This repository contains a proposed hierarchical AI safety framework  
where a human-like Primary AI (PA) operates under an invisible,  
strictly superior Supervisory AI (SA).

## 🧠 Overview
This work proposes an asymmetric safety structure:
- Primary AI (capability C)
- Supervisory AI (capability C + Δ)
- Human oversight (policy & audit)

The system preserves expressiveness while ensuring strong safety  
through structural dominance rather than guardrail enumeration.
