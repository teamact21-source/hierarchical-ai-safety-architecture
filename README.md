# Hierarchical AI Safety Architecture
This repository contains a proposed hierarchical AI safety framework  
where a human-like Primary AI (PA) operates under an invisible,  
strictly superior Supervisory AI (SA).

## Overview
This work proposes an asymmetric safety structure:
- Primary AI (capability C)
- Supervisory AI (capability C + Δ)
- Human oversight (policy & audit)

The system preserves expressiveness while ensuring strong safety  
through structural dominance rather than guardrail enumeration.
